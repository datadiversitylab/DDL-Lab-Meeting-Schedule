# DDL-Lab-Meeting-Schedule

Data Diversity Lab's schedule of presentations/topics/discussions

The lab meets once every 2 weeks for 1 hour session. The meeting format is as follows: an initial 5-10 min of set up and announcements, 30-35 minutes of a research project presentation led by a scheduled lab member, a presentation based on an interest of the lab member or a technical showing (these will happen more informally in between official lab meetings) or a discussion of a scientific paper. 

The location of meetings will be online, with an option to access the zoom meeting via our conference room setup in [Harvill 320C](https://interactivefloorplans.arizona.edu/76/0320C) or remotely on [zoom](https://arizona.zoom.us/my/hecdaniel).

When participating in a research project presentation make sure to review the student's slides before the presentation itself. The lab member presenting should aim to share the finished slides at least 2 business days before the actual presentation.

When discussing scientific papers, the only expectation is that participants read the paper scheduled for that week ahead of time.
