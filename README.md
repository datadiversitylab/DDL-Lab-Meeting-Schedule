# DDL-Lab-Meeting-Schedule

Data Diversity Lab's schedule of presentations/topics/discussions

The lab meets once every 2 weeks for a 1 hour session. Meetings will consist of either: A presentation focused on the lab member's semester project/research, a presentation based on an interest of the lab member/technical showing (these will happen more informally in between official lab meetings) or a discussion of a scientific paper. 
The meeting format is as follows: 
1. Initial 5-10 min of set up and announcements
2. 25-35 minutes of a research project presentation led by a scheduled lab member,
3. The rest of the meeting will consist of topic discussion and Q&A
   
The location of meetings will be mainly online, with an option to access the zoom meeting in a physical shared space via our conference room setup in [Harvill 320C](https://interactivefloorplans.arizona.edu/76/0320C) or remotely on [zoom](https://arizona.zoom.us/my/hecdaniel).

When participating in a research project presentation make sure to review the lab member's slides before the presentation itself. The lab member presenting should aim to share the finished slides at least 2 business days before the actual presentation.

When discussing scientific papers, the only expectation is that participants read the paper scheduled for that week ahead of time.
